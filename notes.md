# TO-DO'S

* Add some validation - I can just do "PRINT" by itself and it "compiles".
* Add a RUN instruction just to test everything I've done so far.
* Add a NEW instruction to clear the program counters/pointers/memory
* Add a command-line option, a file (maybe use the extension ".kso", lol).  That wasy I can just do i.e. "cheese my-test.kso" as I keep tinkering.
* Oh, and add some docs, just cuz :)
