## What is it?

A fun "virtual machine" (and an assembly language for it) that I built in under a week (not for one of those 7-day code challenges, unfortunately).  

## Background

This project arose out of an increased curiosity about building low-level programming/scripting languages.  Of course my BASIC has 2 practical uses - games and shell scripts.  But at the time of this writing it was a crashy mess I didn't feel like debugging.  I wanted something that was fun, and could never feel like work.  Not only that, I wanted to know how "real" BASICs (particularly the 8-bit ones) could be so stable and robust and fit into ~8K of memory.

So, one night I stumbled acros [this little Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6887471/how-would-i-go-about-writing-an-interpreter-in-c) where the "accepted" answer was sort of a mini-challenge: Build a program with a stack (like Forth has) and 6-7 instructions to do stuff with it.  He called it a "very simple stack based virtual machine".  Challenge accepted!

# Documentation

I think what I'll end up doing is creating a GitHub wiki.  I do have the beginning of a manual in the 1.0 branch, but it was very incomplete (a bunch of instructions I hadn't written down yet, etc.).
